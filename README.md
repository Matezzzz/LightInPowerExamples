# LightInPowerExamples
Example outputs for the implementation of article 'light in power' I worked on during the summer of year 2020

We shine a directional light on top of a mirror, and we want the mirror to reflect an input image. For each example, I show the source image, rendered result and the 3D model of a mirror.
